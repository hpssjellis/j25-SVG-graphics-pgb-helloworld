j25-SVG-graphics-pgb-helloworld
=========================

Using SVG graphics with html5 and phonegap. Originally tried to get Canvas using Raphael for phonegap but it did not work.


As of April 10, 2014 Basic SVG works fine. BUT SVG animations do not work in Phonegap Build. Not really a big deal since CSS animations work great and you can also do javascript animations. See other links inside the project.
